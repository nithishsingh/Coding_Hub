# Complete Guide on Python String
In the Article, we learn about string data type in python. we will discuss how to declare the strings data type, access characters in the string, slice techniques and methods that support strings.

Introduction to Python String

A string is an object that contains a sequence of characters. In python the character data type is absent, so a single character is also considered a string. However, we find the character data type in other programming languages like C and Java.

We can declare a python string using a single quote (' string'), a double quote ("string"), a triple quotes ("""string""") or the str() function.

# A single quote string
single_quote = 'a'  # This is an example of a character in other programming languages but it is a string in Python

# Another single quote string
another_single_quote = 'Programming teaches you patience.'

# A double quote string
double_quote = "Make sure you embarce it"

# Another double-quote string
another_double_quote = "It is impossible until it is done!"

# A triple quote string
triple_quote = '''Do small things with great love'''

# Also a triple quote string
another_triple_quote = """Welcome to the Python programming language. Ready, 1, 2, 3, Go!"""

# Using the str() function
string_function = str(123.45)  # str() converts float data type to string data type

# Another str() function
another_string_function = str(True)  # str() converts a boolean data type to string data type

# An empty string
empty_string = ''

# Also an empty string
second_empty_string = ""

# We are not done yet
third_empty_string = """"""  # This is also an empty string: ''''''


Strings can contain any character, such as letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, tabs, newlines, etc. Another way of getting a string in python is using the input() function allows us to get value from the user by default as a string, but we can convert them into other data types.

# Inputs into a Python program
input_float = input()  # Type in: 3.142 
input_boolean = input() # Type in: True

# Convert inputs into other data types
convert_float = float(input_float)  # converts the string data type to a float
convert_boolean = bool(input_boolean) # converts the string data type to a bool

We use the type() function to determine the data type of an object in Python. It returns the class of the object. When the object is a string, it returns the str class. Similarly, it returns dict, int, float, tuple, bool class when the object is a dictionary, integer, float, tuple, or Boolean, respectively. Letâ€™s now use the type() function to determine the data types of variables declared in the previous code snippets:

print(type(single_quote))
print(type(another_triple_quote))
print(type(empty_string))

print(type(input_float))
print(type(input_boolean))

print(type(convert_float))
print(type(convert_boolean))

How to access characters in a string?

We can use square brackets [ ] to access individual characters or slices (substrings) of a string by specifying their index (position) within the string. Each character in a Python string is assigned an index, and the index starts with 0 and must be an integer. There are two ways of accessing the characters: 

using positive integers,

using negative integers.

For negative indexes, the index of -1 refers to the last item, -2 to the second last item, and so on. If you want to access a range of items in a string, you can use the slicing operator, :.

word = "Python"
print(word[:])   # Python
print(word[:4])  # Pyth (character from index 0 to index 3)
print(word[0])   # P
print(word[3])   # h
print(word[-1])  # n
print(word[-2])  # o
print(word[2:5]) # tho
print(word[::2]) # Pto
print(word[::-1]) # nohtyP one of reversing Technique

How to modify string?

Strings are immutable in Python, which means they cannot be changed once created. For example:

word = "Python"
word[0] = "J" # TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

This will raise an error because we cannot assign a new value to an existing character in a string. However, we can create new strings by concatenating (joining) existing strings using the + operator or repeating them using the * operator. For example:

word = "Python"
new_word = "J" + word[1:] # Jython
another_word = word * 3 # PythonPythonPython

Python String Method

Python string methods allow developers to work with strings quickly and it does not the original string. Instead, it is used to return new values.

Some common built-in methods for strings with examples
